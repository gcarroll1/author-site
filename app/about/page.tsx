                Gregory M. Carroll is not just the author of <em>11 Minutes</em>&mdash;he
                lived it. Born and raised in the same tough world as the men in his
                story, he was more than a witness. He was a brother. Ian Carroll was his
                blood, his best man, and the man whose body he had to identify.

                This book is not true crime. It&rsquo;s something deeper. Facts tell you
                what happened. A novel lets you feel it. <em>11 Minutes</em> reaches past
                police reports and courtrooms, into the quiet fears, the slow
                unraveling of loyalty, and the weight of choices made in the dark. It
                tells you not just what people did&mdash;but why.
              </p>

                Greg escaped that world the hard way. Night school. Long hours. He broke
                into the early days of computing, and went on to build two global tech
                companies. Along the way, he earned a Master&rsquo;s in Artificial
                Intelligence and authored two award-winning books on risk and AI&mdash;
                <em>21st Century Enterprise Risk Management</em> and <em>Risk
                Intelligence</em>, the latter a quarterfinalist for the Booklife Prize.
                Now retired, he writes from the Gold Coast, Australia, bringing lived
                experience to the page with sharp insight and unflinching honesty. Just
                like the life that shaped it.

                As an author and speaker, I have been sharing my expertise on the
                practical application of AI in risk management and business
                transformation for over five years. My book <em>Risk Intelligence</em>{" "}
                was a quarter finalist of the international Booklife Prize. I also
                developed an advanced PR3 RAG LLM for user query and analysis of
                airworthiness reports and regulations for the Australian Dept of Defence.
              </p>
              <p>
                With over 19 years of experience as a solutions architect at Fast Track
                (Aust) Pty Ltd, I led the development of an AI-based Governance, Risk &
                Compliance software package that was implemented at over 300 organizations
                across Australia. I also co-founded and developed a Transport Logistics
                software package sold to Linfox, TNT and BP Malaysia, making CMS Transport
                Systems the market leader in Australia. I hold a Master&apos;s degree in
                Artificial Intelligence from Torrens University Australia, a Certificate
                of Machine Learning from Stanford University, and a Grad Dip in Computer
                Simulation from Swinburne University of Technology. I am passionate about
                applying AI to solve complex problems and create value for businesses and
                society.
